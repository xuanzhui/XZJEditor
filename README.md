# XZJEditor
A small tool to encrypt important file. It contains a plain text editor. Decorator pattern and factory pattern are used.

This small tool is to encrypt important plain text file. This is mainly for me to test decorator pattern and factory pattern. For the encryption, it is better that the encrypted bytes length is the same with the original bytes length. I have not tested difference length encryption.
